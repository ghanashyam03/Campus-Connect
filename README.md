Abstract:-


The project objective is to connect students in an Engineering College by creating a 
platform that allows them to interact with each other, share knowledge, and 
collaborate on projects. The platform will be designed to encourage students to form 
communities based on their interests, skills, and career goals. The main objective of 
the platform is to provide students with a supportive and inclusive environment where 
they can network, learn from each other, and explore new ideas. The platform will 
feature various tools such as discussion forums, project management tools, and 
resource sharing, to enable students to work together seamlessly. Ultimately, the 
platform aims to foster a sense of belonging and camaraderie among students and 
contribute to their personal and professional growth.
